                <h2>Choosing the perfect gate</h2>
                <p>
                    When choosing what kind of gate opening style you need, there are a few important factors to consider…

                    <h4>What gate opening style will be best?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Swing gates open inwards on to your driveway. If space is at a premium, meaning that parking space will be limited if 
                        you need to allow for swing gates then you may want to consider a set of sliding gates instead. In order to have a sliding gate installed, 
                        you need to have the equivalent space, the width of your gate to the side of your entrance for the gate to slide back against when open.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Alternatively to traditional sliding gates, if you do not want to undertake groundworks across your driveway to lay tracking, 
                        you could consider using a cantilever system. This suspended way of operating the gate makes for a cleaner looking 
                        install and operates virtually silently.

                    <h4>How to choose a gate design</h4>
                    <p>
                        This is a really significant element to think about when choosing your gate. Not only do you need to choose a style that 
                        compliments your home but also, in some cases, the neighbourhood.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We have developed a series of gate designs which range from being very understated and classic through to extremely 
                        elaborate styles that you will not find elsewhere. The designs in our catalogue are used for inspiration and we have many more 
                        totally bespoke pieces that you can view. Because all of our ironwork is fabricated to order, 
                        we can create virtually anything for you. Regardless of what era your home belongs to, 
                        we have designs that will look perfect on Victorian, Art Deco, modern properties, country cottages and everything else in-between.

                                The traditional choice for residential properties are open patterned Iron gates. 
                                These can be very intricate or simple according to your design ideas. This type of gate is perfect for adding a layer 
                                of security to your property as a burglar deterrent as well as being a stylish addition. 
                                If privacy is a concern then consider a timber gate. All of our wooden gate designs are made with a sturdy steel 
                                frame and infilled with Frake hardwood. A closed boarded gate style not only enhances your home security 
                                but can also help to shield traffic noise in your garden if you reside on a busy road.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If you live in an area which is prone to high winds then you might be best to choose open pattern iron gates or 
                                only partially clad gates if you still want the privacy screen of a timber gate. Wind resistance 
                                causes a fully cladded / closed boarded wooden gate to become an extremely large sail which would be 
                                inoperable manually (both physically & safely) in windy conditions and if the gates are automated, 
                                puts massive strain on gate equipment.

                        <div class="faq-answer" style="display:none;">
                            <p>
                                Iron gates require virtually no maintenance once installed but wooden gates do require some annual attention that you may wish to consider. 
                                Our hardwood gates are treated with a UV protecting varnish that will help keep the wood safe from the elements. 
                                We recommend that each year the gates are cleaned, lightly sanded and another coat applied. This will keep them at their best 
                                for the longest possible time.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If you are reluctant to undertake basic maintenance on your gates then you could consider aluminium infills instead. 
                                These look just like wood but you do not need to treat them at all.
                                All of our wooden and aluminium infill gates are made with a heavy duty steel frame which allows us to create stunning and practical designs.
                            </p>
 
                            <p>
                                Regardless what type of gate you choose, all of our ironwork is galvanised prior to painting. This process involves dipping the finished 
                                ironwork in to a vat of molten zinc. Once complete, this provides the steel with a permanent rust proof coat which can 
                                be painted directly over. Your gates will last a lifetime after this process.
                            </p>
 
                            <p>
                                Your painted ironwork will require an occasional clean with mild soapy water to keep it looking like new.

                                This is all dependant on how you use your gates! If it is a side entrance that is rarely used or you have a pedestrian gate 
                                and on street parking then you may not be frequently opening your driveway gates. 
                                If this is the case then manual gates are suitable for that purpose. They could just have a simple latch 
                                and drop bolt or even have a locking handle for extra security.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                However, if the gates are going on to a driveway requiring regular access then it is best to have them automated, 
                                especially if your property is on a busy road where stopping to manually open your gates would cause a safety problem.

                                There is no denying that decorative ironwork can be a significant investment, whatever your budget happens to be.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The general rule is that gates and railings which are of a bespoke design with lots of handmade, 
                                elaborate elements are always going to be the more costly option compared to a simple design using readily available components.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Regardless of your budget, we can make the highest quality ironwork to suit your pocket and property.

                                It is worth considering servicing & maintenance costs if you are having your gates automated. A gate system needs to be serviced 
                                annually to keep it running smoothly and reliably. We offer both Silver and Gold Warranty packages which are 
                                particularly useful to keep your gates running and protect you from unknown breakdown charges.
                            </p>

                                Not only does exterior ironwork make your home look well cared for and secure, it also adds value and sale-ability to the property with added kerb appeal, making it a smart investment.
