                        Whilst our designs are purely for inspiration, you may wish to leave them exactly the way they are or perhaps make some alterations to suit 
                        your own style. Since all of our gates are made to order, this is no problem.

                        If you have an idea in mind already, we are happy to discuss your concepts too. We can make just about anything and always welcome a challenge!

                                From a site meeting or from client imagery, we give expert advice on design, fixing methods & recommend how 
                                we would manage such a project.

                                Once the drawings are approved these are sent to our fabrication department to be made.

                                All of our ironwork is manufactured at our main Factory & Headquarters in Nelson, Lancashire using a combination of age old 
                                blacksmithing techniques and modern machinery.
                                Our craftsmanship and attention to detail is evident in every aspect of our work and we ensure that our quality is always consistent.

                                Hot-dipped galvanizing is a process of coating mild steel by immersing the fabricated product in a bath of molten zinc at 
                                a temperature of around 900 °F. This involves chemically cleaning prior to dipping to remove any substrates & once completed, 
                                the zinc coating is fully bonded to the Ironwork. This guarantees the longest possible lifetime 
                                for anything metal affected by outside elements, such as rain, frost or snow, along with the least maintenance also.

                    <p>
                        We paint all of our Ironwork using our own specially formulated High Build Vinyl Paint for a reliable long lasting finish. British Standard 
                        recommendations are 80 microns of film coating to protect against outside elements & we always increase this to 120 microns. 
                        Everything is spray painted using our electrostatically charged paint process ensuring full “wraparound” coverage. 
                        This method ensures the smoothest and most even surface along with a soft sheen appearance. 
                        One of the main features of this finish is that it has elastic-type properties which allows the metalwork to expand & 
                        contract without cracking in extreme hot & cold temperatures, something that powder coating will not.

                    <h4>Finishing</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our metal gates and railings can be given a variety of finishes after painting including patinas. As standard we use gold, 
                        silver & bronze brushed very lightly over the contours to highlight the detail in the work, bringing the design to life. 
                        Alternatively, ironwork can be left with a plain painted finish or for the more extravagant option we have 
                        Everlasting Gold paint which certain details such as Railheads, Bushes, Cages etc. 
                        can be painted fully to give that Midas Touch. Our Hardwood gates are finished using UV protective coatings, 
                        which not only shield the wood from fading, but also enriches the natural grain and beauty, achieving a glossy sheen.

                    <p>
                        When installing automation a range of safety tests need to be carried out including force testing and CE marking before we leave site.
                        All of this will be explained to you when you place your order including information regarding the amount of safety edges 
                        and photocells you will need for your gate type.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rest assured that we only ever install automation systems that are safe and 
                        reliable as not only do we have over 30 years’ experience in this field, we are accredited members of Gate Safe and DHF.

                    <p>
                        If you have chosen to have your gates automated; once all relevant safety tests have been carried out by the engineer you will receive 
                        a ‘Handover Pack’ including all site risk assessment information and documentation including the testing procedure.
                    </p>

                    <p>You also receive a 12 month parts and labour warranty from the completion date on installed automation and access control systems.</p>

                    <p>
                        Servicing is optional although we do highly recommend that you have your gates serviced annually. We have both Gold & Silver service 
                        plans which can be explained to you.
